# A Star Just Wants To Go Home
A Star Just Wants To Go Home is an educational game designed for Astronomy Club Booth for Spring Carnival 2018 and for the course Educational Game Design.

The game is a single-player exploration-based educational game designed to teach players the basic operation of a telescope and navigating the night sky to find objects.

The player must navigate the night sky in order to reassemble the scattered stars from a constellation.  They must do this by switching between three different game views (night sky, viewfinder, telescope) to move their player character to get stars of different brightness.  Once the stars are collected, the player must then reassemble the constellations into the correct configuration.
